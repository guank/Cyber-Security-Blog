        <h1>Week 2: Forensics</h1>
        <p>Name: Kevin Guan</p><br>
        <p>Week two's main subject dealt with the elaborate process behind machine forensics. The subject contains many intricacies and procedures in the gathering and reporting of data. There was a strong emphasis throughout the lectures that focused on the importance of attention and discretion. One improper move can destroy the data and the rest of the evidence like pulling the plug or not pulling the plug during confiscation. The risk associated with pulling the machine's plug could result in a data wipe when the machine shuts down; however, if the machine remains plugged in, there is the risk that somebody can remotely wipe the machine's data. The forensics investigator must be keen to read the situation and environment to make the best decision.</p>
        <p>In addition, it is also very important for forensics investigator to be keep nearly perfect notes for reporting the details later. The judges in courts nail people to the bone in regards to the information that was gathered. If attorneys discover a flaw in the gathered material, they can take advantage of it and ridicule the forensics investigator which may lead to a loss for the case. Forensics investigator must be tight when they create their reports, which was one of the key points that was emphasized in the guidelines for evidence collection and archiving document, RFC 3227.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the field of forensics is constantly changing due to the fast pace in the evolution of new technology. As mentioned by Christian, forensics must always think outside the box to combat the new approaches that are used by criminals and find new methods to discover clues for investigation like understanding XBox forensics or Playstation forensics. Those gaming consoles can easily be overlooked at first, but they can potentially still be used to investigate the network for useful data. Additionally, when forensics comes upon unfamiliar technology like solid state drives, they must also be able to adapt and learn when they come across these obstacles. Another instance is the evolution of disk drive sizes. One of the greater challenges that forensics experience is the sheer size of disk drives. The task of analyzing terabytes after terabytes of information in small timeframes is something that forensics must take into consideration when tackling their cases nowadays.</p>
        <p>One of the most intriguing concept that was mentioned in this week's lecture was the usage of a supercomputer to hack into encrypted memory devices. Media has portrayed encryption as the uncrackable safe that is used by many companies for storing information and maintaining privacy. The idea that advanced encryption can now be cracked through a supercomputer is mindblowing. Further, the construction of a supercomputer through the collection of numerous Playstations was also astonishing.</p>
