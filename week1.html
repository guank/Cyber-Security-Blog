        <h1>Week 1: Basics of Malware</h1>
        <p>Name: Kevin Guan</p><br>
        <p>Throughout the first week's lectures, the main subjects involved overviews of the more common malware forms and understanding the safe practices in handling malware. A common method that people use to infect computers involve the usage of USB sticks. Programmers are now able to configure them to steal information at the instant when somebody inserts one of these rigged USB sticks into a machine. The surprising infection vector is PDF. After using PDF files for homework assignments for so long, it is shocking to learn that PDFs contain numerous security issues that can be abused. The fact that its usage is still widespread is startling. </p>
        <p>Christian also went over the basic terminologies that are commonly found in the field. White is the term that deemed for objects that are clean, while Black signifies the opposite. Gray is the middleground for programs that have a dangerous number of permissions to important directories like anti-malware software. Goats are the machines that are used as a dummy to test malware with honeypots are used to attract malware for investigation. The usage of goats is very pivotal for learning the behavior of malware and allows investigators to replicate the behavior of the malware, so they can properly prevent the malware from spreading even further.
        </p>
        <p>One of the most interesting topic was the breakdown of the process that takes place behind ransomware. The key basis of ransomware involves hackers using software like TorLocker and Cryptowall to lock their victims out of their computers remotely. Since the private key is on the hacker's server, the lock on the victim's computer is very likely going to be uncrackable. As a result, victims usually have little to zero options to recover their files and system outside of paying the ransomware's demands. The fact that hackers have also used ransomware to target and attack large companies in the past is alarming. If hackers are able to infect large companies that have some of the most hefty security on the market, then ordinary personal computers are easy targets if a proficient hacker decides to break in. This notion becomes even more eerie when considering that most objects that surrounds people today can be hacked and tampered. </p>
