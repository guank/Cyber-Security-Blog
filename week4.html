        <h1>Week 4: Software Vulnerabilities</h1>
        <p>Name: Kevin Guan</p><br>
        <p>During this week, the main focus was towards the vulnerabilities of common software and their exploits. One of the main methods for demonstrating this concept was shown through the usage of WinDBG. The basis of WinDBG allows testers to be able to look at vulnerabilities by getting a program to certain crash point in order to debug it. Accordingly, one of the main goals with using WinDBG is to determine whether a certain crash can be controlled and exploited for the tester's advantage. The first experiment introduces this concept of WinDBG through an analysis of an attack against an Internet Explorer browser. For this experiment, the ActiveX Control, FSExploitMe.ocx, is loaded into Internet Explorer as part of its memory. Afterwards, WinDBG is able to be used to inspect the frozen state of the current internet browser of its processes and allocations. While the first lab's goal was mainly to familiarize the common commands seen in WinDBG and understand where specific information is located when prompted, in the second experiment, the process involves investigating different memory blocks on the heap and changing it up to manipulate different crash scenarios.</p>
        <p>Another subject that was explored in the Brad's lecture is memory corruption. Memory corruption is generally known as accessing memory in an invalid method which results in some form of undefined behavior. This vulnerability is usually due to the fault of some type of input from anything like a listener or a bot. The type of memory corruptions can have many different forms and categorized into different categories. One of the most common type of memory corruption seen in today's time is buffer length calculations which was demonstrated in the lecture via a stack overflow that is caused through the copying of a user defined string and executing a saved return address that is undefined.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Brad's anecdotes of his experiences with Bug Bounty Programs were very fascinating. The most surprising fact was that his experience with Samsung almost led him into a lawsuit with the company. In a time where countless hackers are ready to take advantage of the smallest exploit, I assumed most people have the belief that the learning of an exposed security flaw is a positive event that many companies would appreciate rather than transferring the contributor to the legal sector for questioning. Fortunately, it was relieving to hear that the event ended with an award for the efforts rather than a lawsuit.</p>
